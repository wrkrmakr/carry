            	<h3>Why Carry Maternity?</h3>
                <p>To carry is an act of love. When pregnant women ‘carry’ a baby, they turn their bodies over willingly to nourish new life.</p>
				<p>Dads carry children as well. My son, when he was just learning to speak, would lift up his arms to my husband and say, "Carry?" It would melt your heart.</p>
				<p>When the community is at its best, we carry each other. As they say, it takes a village to raise a child.</p>
				<p>Formerly Rhonda Maternity, Carry Maternity is a freshly reborn boutique in Toronto’s Yorkville neighbourhood.  As the new owner, I ensure we have a carefully chosen selection of clothes from a variety of maternity designers. We show women how to put together a versatile and interesting wardrobe with just a few pieces. As the designer, I create the Carry Maternity collection with all types of figures in mind. Our private label offers on-trend maternity fashions for work, home and special occasions – all made in Canada and available at accessible prices. We make every garment count.</p>
				<p>Body fit is everything to us. We don't just follow the trends; we integrate them so that they fit and flatter your growing curves. You can wear any shape when it’s proportioned correctly for your changing body.</p>  
				<p>Let us help you put together a maternity wardrobe that works for you and makes you feel like yourself. You can also check out our lines of beauty and health products to nourish you throughout your pregnancy as well as nursing essentials for after the baby is born.</p>
				<p>With love,</p><br />
